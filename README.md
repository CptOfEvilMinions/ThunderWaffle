## Abstract

Adversaries are constantly coming up with new methods to thwart the effectiveness of security controls. Threat hunting provides a truly proactive solution to hunt for adversaries before they complete their mission. This research will create a matrix of adversary techniques to hunt for on a network and a mechanism to classify the actions of advanced persistent threats (APT).
