# Online survey

In addition to public data and resources a survey was conducted for this research. All the documents pertaining to this survey are contained in this folder.

## Purpose

The nature of APT is to be advanced and undetectable which as a result, lead to this research. Public resources are been released on threat actors but these resources did not provide the detail required for this research. Additionally, it may take up to several years to monitor a threat actor and then report on there techniques, tactics, and procedures.

This survey was created in hopes to fill this void by asking the infosec community to fill in the missing details. As a result, our matrix should contain data of past threat actors and current threat actors.
