## Methods

* HTTP
* FTP
* SMTP/E-mail attachments
* DNS

## Types of data

* "Sensitive files"
* E-mails
* User credentials

## Malware/Threat actors
{% assign malwares = 'Operation Cleaver,GRIZZLY STEPPE' | split: ',' %}

{% include threat_actor_table.html %}

## Mitigations

`<Mitigation techniques>`

## Detections

* Persistent connections outbound with a high amount of data
* DNS exfil channels - Large payloads that are encoded
* FTP connections being initiated outbound
* Analyze traffic flows looking for certain anomalous behaviors such as prolonged connections, data frequently being pushed to the server (e.g., commands being sent to the shell), frequent large data transfers (an indication of data exfiltration), and abnormal encryption (anything that is not SSL/TLS or that negotiates using an alternate certificate) as indicators of potential nefarious activity.2
