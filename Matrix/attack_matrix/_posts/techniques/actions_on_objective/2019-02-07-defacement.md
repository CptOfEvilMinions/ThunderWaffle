[Website defacement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Website_defacement) is an attack on a website that changes the visual appearance of the site or a webpage. These are typically the work of defacers, who break into a web server and replace the hosted website with one of their own. Defacement is generally meant as a kind of electronic graffiti and, as other forms of vandalism, is also used to spread messages by politically motivated "cyber protesters" or hacktivists[1].
