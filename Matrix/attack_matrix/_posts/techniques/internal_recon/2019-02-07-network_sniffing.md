# `Network sniffing- <technique ID>`

[Network Sniffing](http://www.valencynetworks.com/articles/cyber-security-attacks-network-sniffing.html) involves capturing, decoding, inspecting and interpreting the information inside a network packet on a TCP/IP network. The purpose is to steal information, usually user IDs, passwords, network details, credit card numbers, etc. Sniffing is generally referred to as a “passive” type of attack, wherein the attackers can be silent/invisible on the network. This makes it difficult to detect, and hence it is a dangerous type of attack.
