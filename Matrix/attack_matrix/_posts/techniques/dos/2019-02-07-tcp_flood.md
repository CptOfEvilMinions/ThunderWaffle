# `TCP SYN flood - <technique ID>`

A [TCP SYN flood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SYN_flood) is a form of denial-of-service attack in which an attacker sends a succession of SYN requests to a target's system in an attempt to consume enough server resources to make the system unresponsive to legitimate traffic

## Malware/Threat actors

{% assign malwares = 'DarkComet,Operation Cleaver' | split: ',' %}

{% include threat_actor_table.md %}


## Mitigations

One mitigation is to rate limit the amount of unqiue connections from a source IP address or to a destination port.

## Detections

Using the BRO `conn.log` to look for a large number of connections to a particular host with a `conn_state` set to `S0`(Connection attempt seen, no reply.).
