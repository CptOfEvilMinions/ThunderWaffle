# `Poisoned torrents - <technique ID>`

The technique of threat actors deploying torrent files onto torrent sites that are pre- infected with malware has not been widely seen before, especially with respect to BitTorrent-types of attack. This behaviour is difficult to trace and track and is indiscriminate in its infection pattern unless it has some means of targeting desired demographics.
