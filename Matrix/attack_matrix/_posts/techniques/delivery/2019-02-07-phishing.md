## Mitigations

* Look for domain typo-squat domains(Real domain: google.com, Typo-squat: googlw.com).
* Utilize up to date web browsers on the network for increased security enhancements. These improvements may include a sandboxing feature that would allow the browser to contain any malicious content and protect the endpoint if an emailed link is clicked.
* Deploy web and email filters on the network and configure these devices to scan for known bad domains, sources, and addresses; block these before messages are received and downloaded. This action will help to reduce the attack surface at the network’s first level of defense. In addition, attachments should be filtered. The network defenses should only allow approved extensions to pass through to the email client. Most .exe, scripting extensions (including .bat, .js, and .ps1) and other executable extensions should be blocked.
