# `Phishing - <technique ID>`

Phishing is the practice of sending fraudulent communications that appear to come from a reputable source. It is usually done through email. The goal is to steal sensitive data like credit card and login information, or to install malware on the victimâ€™s machine.

{% assign threat_actors = site.data.threat_actors %}
{% assign malwares = 'Operation Cleaver,Epic Turla,Energetic Bear,APT37' | split: ',' %}

| Name | Type | Description | Year(s) | Source |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | - |
{%- for malware in malwares %}
    {% assign tmp = threat_actors[0][malware] -%}
    | {{ malware }} | {{ tmp.type }} | {{ tmp.description }} | {{ tmp.years }} |
    {%- for source in tmp.sources -%}
        {%- assign source1 = source | split:'/' -%}
