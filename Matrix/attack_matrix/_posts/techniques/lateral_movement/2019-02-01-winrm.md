# WinRM
[Windows Remote Management (WinRM)](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1028/) is the name of both a Windows service and a protocol that allows a user to interact with a remote system (e.g., run an executable, modify the Registry, modify services). [1] It may be called with the winrm command or by any number of programs such as PowerShell. [2]
