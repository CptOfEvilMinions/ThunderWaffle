# `Exploit - <technique ID>`

An [exploit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exploit_(computer_security)) (from the English verb to exploit, meaning "to use something to oneâ€™s own advantage") is a piece of software, a chunk of data, or a sequence of commands that takes advantage of a bug or vulnerability to cause unintended or unanticipated behavior to occur on computer software, hardware, or something electronic (usually computerized). Such behavior frequently includes things like gaining control of a computer system, allowing privilege escalation, or a denial-of-service (DoS or related DDoS) attack.
