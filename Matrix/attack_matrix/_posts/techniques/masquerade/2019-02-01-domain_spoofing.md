# `Domain spoofing - <technique ID>`

[Domain Spoofing](https://www.barracuda.com/glossary/domain-spoofing), a common form of phishing, occurs when an attacker appears to use a companyâ€™s domain to impersonate a company or one of its employees.

This can be done by sending emails with false domain names which appear legitimate, or by setting up websites with slightly altered characters that read as correct. Commonly, a spoof website or email will use logos, or any other kind of accurate visual design to effectively imitate the styling and branding of a legitimate enterprise or business. Users will commonly be prompted to enter financial details or other sensitive data, trusting that they are being sent to the right place.
